->Functionality:
Generates passwords containing a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers.
Offers customization for password length:
Specify a desired length for each password.
Option for passwords with random lengths between a minimum and maximum (e.g., 3 and 10 characters).
Ensures each password includes at least one uppercase letter and one number.
Able to generate multiple passwords at once.
  
  
->Instructions:

->Save the script: Create a new Python file (e.g., secure_password_generator.py) and copy the code into it.
->Run the script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the Python file, and execute the command python secure_password_generator.py.

->Security Reminders:

->It's highly recommended to use a password manager for secure password storage.
->Never share your generated passwords with anyone.
